# Bluetooth Based Robot Control
 Bluetooth Based Robot Control using PIC Microcontroller


* This Mini-Project requires PIC18F4520 to control Motors, Bluetooth Module(HC-05) and other components.
* I have attached code of Protecus design to communicate with motors and Bluetooth Module with UART communication from Android Mobile.
* The user will send the instruction through Android mobile and the bluetooth module will get the signal. The BAUD RATE for bluetooth communication is set to 9600 for communication. * * *       * Depending upon the signal aquired the Robot Car will move in all directions.
